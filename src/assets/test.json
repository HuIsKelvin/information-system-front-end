        "AB": "In this paper, we propose a discriminative video representation for event detection over a large scale video dataset when only limited hardware resources are available. The focus of this paper is to effectively leverage deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to advance event detection, where only frame level static descriptors can be extracted by the existing CNN toolkits. This paper makes two contributions to the inference of CNN video representation. First, while average pooling and max pooling have long been the standard approaches to aggregating frame level static features, we show that performance can be significantly improved by taking advantage of an appropriate encoding method. Second, we propose using a set of latent concept descriptors as the frame descriptor, which enriches visual information while keeping it computationally affordable. The integration of the two contributions results in a new state-of-the-art performance in event detection over the largest video datasets. Compared to improved Dense Trajectories, which has been recognized as the best video representation for event detection, our new representation improves the Mean Average Precision (mAP) from 27.6% to 36.8% for the TRECVID MEDTest 14 dataset and from 34.0% to 44.6% for the TRECVID MEDTest 13 dataset.",

        "AB": "Profiling Web users is a fundamental issue for Web mining and social network analysis. Its basic tasks include extracting basic information, mining user preferences, and inferring user demographics (Tang et al. in ACM Trans Knowl Discov Data 5(1):2:1â€“2:44, 2010). Although methodologies for handling the three tasks are different, they all usually contain two stages: first identify relevant pages (data) of a user and then use machine learning models (e.g., SVM, CRFs, or DL) to extract/mine/infer profile attributes from each page. The methods were successful in the traditional Web, but are facing more and more challenges with the rapid evolution of the Web each persons information is distributed over the Web and is changing dynamically. As a result, available data for a user on the Web is redundant, and some sources may be out-of-date or incorrect. The traditional two-stage method suffers from data â€¦",

        "AB": "This study introduces a system named CareerMap that visualizes a scholarâ€™s career trajectory. As an online demonstration of CareerMap, we have shown the visualization result by CareerMap for the AMiner 2016 most influential scholars in machine learning (ML) 1). Each trajectory path on the map represents the movement of a scholar between different places (affiliations). The heatmap reveals the geographic distribution of the most influential ML scholars; a larger hotspot means a larger immigration of scholars into an affiliation. The right sidebar is a list of all scholars. When the user selects (clicks on) a scholar, the trajectory path of that scholar is highlighted in the map. The bottom bar shows the timeline. When the user selects a specific year, a textbox at the bottom displays the most important work (paper) published in that year by a scholar in the right-hand list. This example provides the track records of over half of the most influential ML scholars at the east and west coasts of the USA, and in west Europe. By zooming in, the user can also check the city-level results or obtain finer details.)\nCareerMap can benefit many applications. For example, if the movements of all experts in artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide were displayed on a visual map, government strategy departments could better understand the talent distribution and accordingly design wise AI strategies. Similarly, CareerMap can assist the design of smart",
